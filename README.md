# tstemplate2

This is a new TypoScript Template backend module using extbase + fluid +ExtJS

Currently only the TypoScript ObjectBrowser is working. But is already uses ExtJS to show the TypoScript
tree for quick and responsive closing/opening of TypoScript sub keys.

This extension works with current TYPO3 master (7.3-dev)
